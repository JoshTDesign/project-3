## Description: 
We created our application to make it easier for groups of friends and families to plan vacations easier within their group. Our application provides users and friends an all in one application where you, as the user is able to track the groups itinerary, find new activities to add to the agenda, and keep track of your budget. With our application you can do it all.

## Install:
